Yes, I'm starting my blog with the most cliche title there is.
But as I was thinking about what to write as my first post, in my mind came a memory of my first C program back in 2011 when I first started my Computer Science course at the University of Brasília - Brazil 👨‍💻.

```c{}[hello-world.c]
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf(“Hello World”);
    return 0
}
```

For me, seeing that phrase on the computer screen and thinking that I was able to do that with code, that was the moment that I became in love with programming.

Fast forward back to now, seeing the actual dev scenario, with a new programming language, framework, npm package emerge every day, I, as a developer, feel overwhelmed, so I imagine people that are starting now in the dev life, too much content, too many tools, so I decided to start blogging at first to help these people with the first steps, to bring some Computer Science content to the dev blog field, and also to make content for Javascript developers because I :heart: javascript and blog posts saved my life in many occasions.

**My blog is i18n [ 🇺🇸, 🇧🇷, 🇪🇸 ]**

Another motive is to create content that reaches more people in the world. Because I’m Brazilian and have Spanish citizenship, all my blog posts are gonna have an English, Portuguese, and Spanish version. That way I can train my language skills :world_map: and share more knowledge.

And when you teach 👨‍🏫, you learn twice.

So that’s my **Hello World** to the blog life.
